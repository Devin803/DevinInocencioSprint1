This program will query the completed CUBES form and put them into a text file

UPDATE 2/8: The program will now create a database for the wufoo forms to easily access information
The program does not need any installs to run

UPDATE 2/20: The program will now create a GUI window when run and display data created from the wufoo forms. Has basic functionality and still needs some styling
